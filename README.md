#### Heya

I'm Noa, aka coolreader. I use they/them or she/her pronouns, and I'm interested
in programming languages and compilers, Rust, and systems programming. I'm a
core contributor and maintainer to
[RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython), a python interpreter
written in Rust. In the past, I've worked on robot-rumble with a friend, which
is a spiritual successor to robotgame that lets you code up robot AIs and run
them in the browser, on your computer, or on our servers, using WebAssembly and
wasmer.

Currently, I'm a software engineer at
[clockwork labs](https://github.com/clockworklabs).
