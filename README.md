#### Heyo

I'm Noah, aka coolreader. I use they/them pronouns, and I'm interested in
programming languages and compilers, Rust, and systems programming. I'm a core
contributor to RustPython, a python interpreter written in Rust. I also work on
robot-rumble with a friend, which is a spiritual successor to robotgame that
lets you code up robot AIs and run them in the browser, on your computer, or on
our servers, using WebAssembly and wasmer.

You can reach me through my discord,
[coolreader18#8124](https://discord.com/users/191362465886502912), and I'm on
the [RustPython gitter page](https://gitter.im/rustpython/Lobby) as well.
